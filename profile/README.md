# Datafruits hacking repository

Datafruits is a cooperatively owned and operated free-form net radio station. This website was created by and for fans of internet radio and netlabels. Our station has little to no curation, and we believe that any song can be played.

With artists around the globe, we are located throughout the US, Tokyo, and Seoul. Our goal is to provide an accessible space for the international music community; Particularly for underserved and marginalized communities.

The site has had no sponsorships or advertisements since 2012, and all of our support comes from the listeners, artists, and the generosity of strangers on the internet. We may live in a "Platform capitalist" world now, but that doesn't mean we're alone. We can help make the world a better place with a bit of cooperation and understanding. And remember, it's just a website.
